## About Joypad

Joypad is building the future of input.

We're developing a modern platform for controllers, adapters, and human–computer interaction technologies — beginning with the open-source successor to USBRetro, and evolving into something much broader.

Our focus is simple:

- Modern, universal input compatibility  
- Clean, extensible firmware architecture  
- Developer-friendly tools  
- Openness and interoperability  
- A long-term vision that blends hardware, software, and intelligence

Most of this work is happening quietly behind the scenes for now.  
More will be shared as components stabilize and reach public readiness.

If you're interested in what we're building, keep an eye on this organization.  
New projects will begin appearing here soon.

## Repositories (Coming Soon)

- **JoyOS** — a tiny, cross-platform embedded OS for controller and adapter firmware  
- **Joypad Studio** — tools for configuring, testing, and building JoyOS apps  
- **Joypad Cloud** — shared profiles, mappings, and device intelligence  
- Libraries, HAL layers, protocol modules, adapters, and developer samples

## Community & Contributions

The first public modules will open for early contributors soon.  
If you work in embedded systems, gaming hardware, BLE/USB stacks, or controller tech, we’d love to have you involved.

For now, you can star or watch the organization to follow updates.
